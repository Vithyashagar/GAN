# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

This repo is created to test and save the files related to GAN. 

One of the examples of GAN is generating handwritten images from scratch. Which is done in the [Handwriting_GAN](https://github.com/Vithyashagar/GAN/blob/main/Handwriting_GAN.ipynb) notebook.
Below gif is an example of how the model performs under 50 Epochs.
